# YouTube-videos
This repository contains the MANIM code for the animations in my YouTube videos at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrmef-kSIRH8SzCLa89l_xA

You might get some errors as I've modified the source code slightly according to my workflow. Feel free to contact me on discord (Abhijith#4590) for any issues regarding the code.
